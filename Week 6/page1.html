        <h2>Space Game or Space Game: Nakara</h2>
        Last semester in Cory's Game Development class I made a game!<br>
        (Super creative naming statigies...I know.)<br>

        Space Game is a narrative space opera made in Twine. 
        You explore the solar system, Nakara, and uncover the secrets of its history.

        <h2>The Genesys Experiments</h2>
        The first 12 pages of a Cyberpunk book I have in development. 
        It is set in the same universe as Space Game, but instead of being in Nakara, it is in the Milky Way. 
        The story follows a character named Nano who struggles to navigate the last major city on Earth.
