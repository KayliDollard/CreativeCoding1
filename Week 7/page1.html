        <h2>Space Game or Space Game: Nakara</h2>
        Last semester in Cory's Game Development class I made a game!<br>
        (Super creative naming statigies...I know.)<br>
        <img src="SpaceShip.png" height="200" width="200"><br>

        Space Game is a narrative space opera made in Twine.<br>
        You explore the solar system, Nakara, and uncover the secrets of its history.<br>
        You can find Space Game on my itch! SpaceWalker11<br>

        <h2>The Genesys Experiments</h2>
        The first 12 pages of a Cyberpunk book I have in development.<br> 
        It is set in the same universe as Space Game, but instead of being in Nakara, it is in the Milky Way. <br>
        The story follows a character named Nano who struggles to navigate the last major city on Earth.  <br>
