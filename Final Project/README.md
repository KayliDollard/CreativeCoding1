Final Project Proposal: Map for The Genesys Experiments

Description: 
The next major step in my fiction project is to get my maps of the city set in stone (my workshop had some issues with geography). I figured it would be fun to make said map online and semi-interactive. You will be able to hover over the sectors to see the highlighted borders. You will have some access to information and/or history of the places (see what I want). Ultimately, I want my readers/project to have a map that will help them remember what each major sector is and what they stand for to make my writing easier to understand and write. 

Examples: 
	Terry Brook’s The Chronicles of Shannara books use small sectors of the map of the world. This allows him to have a huge world but only focus on the pieces of it that are important to the specific book without confusing a reader a gigantic map. 

This map I found on P5.js:  https://editor.p5js.org/Kumu-Paul/sketches/8awPJGZQ4

Problems: 
	I am worried about getting the odd shapes of some of the sectors within the map. I’ve been looking at the code of the above World map and still can’t figure out how they managed to have each country appear. 
	The art and sketches I may need to use and/or finding assets for many of the pieces I’ve proposed (I will gladly do it myself but it might not be very pretty).
	The zoom mechanic/how much information is worth telling (hence the multiple choices). 
** I would really love some feedback on what you think will be difficult enough for this final project as well as if you think I can do it. 

Schedule:
April 20th - April 24th: Have the map drawn and within a P5.js file. 
•	Map of buttons and collisions
o	Should be able to highlight the different sectors when the mouse is over them
April 25th - April 27th: Click function, zoom function/closer look
•	What I want:
o	When clicked, something happens (have not decided yet) 
	The sector is pulled up in a larger screen overlay. 
•	Brief description of the main symbols of the area
	When clicked, get small interaction
•	Ie: a car zooms over the screen 
	A zoomed-in view of a simple picture
April 28th - May 4th: Final edits and testing
•	Throughout the project, if things are moving faster than I expect, I want to add the other maps I need.
o	When you click upward, you will also have access to a map of the upper city
 
Some work I’ve done:
•	I made this proposal.
•	I have sketched of what I want the map to look like on paper. 
•	Sifting through examples on P5.js to find examples of code that will help me.
