The Learning Style Test: The test got at least part of my learning style. 
I am very much a visual learner. That being said, I am also kind of like a sponge. 
When I listen to a lecture or someone telling a story, chances are it will be committed to memory. 
Due to this I think auditory learning should have been a lot higher than it was. 
I am also a strong believer that if I learn something once, I will be able to figure it out forever.
Once im shown where something is I might need a couple reminders but usually Iâ€™ll have it down.
