The biggest difference between a command line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI) can be found in their names. 
A CLI uses types/written commands (think /weather or /set time day from Minecraft, or bb.moveobjects and other testing cheats in the sims 4). Ultimately, using commands in this form is more powerful and allows you to have a lot more control over what you’re doing. It’s a great tool for troubleshooting and organizing more thoroughly (as long as you know the commands). The organizational aspect of CLI is very useful in a development atmosphere because it allows the different contributors to streamline their work and have easier access to each other’s files/libraries. In the same field, the interface allows you to enter one command and find something with one typed line instead of having to follow step-by-step directions. 
The definition of GUI’s is also laid out in its name. It uses graphics to allow the user access to the interface (think the trash bin or all the game logos that may be on your desktop, or the none cheat pieces of a video game). Since GUI’s creation in the 1970s, it has become the industry standard because it’s simplified and, while not necessarily efficient in a computing sense, far quicker to use than CLI. Due to its innovations, GUI is more accessible to the average person. In addition, the graphic approach tends to make navigating to things like the trash bin far more intuitive than a string command would be.
